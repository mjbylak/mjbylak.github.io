I've interned at JB Hunt Transport Inc. since my second year in college, served as a Senior Project Lead with the McMillon Studio of Innovation for four separate projects, each one with a different company, and conducted research and development on various hardware and software projects with the National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission (NCREPT). At the start of 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in a three part study abroad in London, Berlin, and Rome, so I unfortunately had to discontinue my positions with NCREPT and JB Hunt.
