      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Mitchell Bylak completed his Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from the University
        of Arkansas in December of 2023. He has interned at JB Hunt Transport Inc. since his second
        year in college, served as a Senior Project Lead with the McMillon Studio of Innovation for
        four separate projects, each one with a different company, and conducted research and
        development on various hardware and software projects with the National Center for Reliable
        Electric Power Transmission (NCREPT). At the start of 2024, Mitchell had the incredible
        opportunity to participate in a three part study abroad in London, Berlin, and Rome, so he
        unfortunately had to discontinue his positions with NCREPT and JB Hunt.
